      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Harsh Vardhan Singh, a first-year student at IIM Bangalore, currently pursuing a BBA in Digital Business and Entrepreneurship. I have a deep passion for the digital world, and I’m fascinated by how technology and innovation can disrupt traditional business models. Along with my academic journey, I strive to develop my entrepreneurial mindset, focusing on both practical and strategic aspects of business development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in leveraging technology to drive business growth and improve efficiency. From content creation to digital marketing, I actively engage with various aspects of the digital ecosystem. I believe in the power of collaboration and innovation to solve problems and create meaningful solutions. Whether it’s through my podcast, content creation, or my academic studies, I aim to build something impactful that helps others and contributes to the evolving digital landscape.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy exploring new trends in technology, reading books on entrepreneurship, and experimenting with creative content. My academic experience at IIM Bangalore is giving me a solid foundation in both digital business principles and entrepreneurial strategies, helping me shape my vision for the future.

        <h3>Aawaz-e-Dil Podcast</h3>
        <p>
          As part of my journey in content creation, I launched a podcast called <strong>Aawaz-e-Dil</strong>, where I host conversations with inspiring individuals, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders across various fields. The podcast is focused on soul-stirring discussions, personal growth, and the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first episode, featuring Anand Dwivedi, a renowned social media personality with deep insights into meditation and mindfulness, was an incredible success. Anand Dwivedi has a massive following with around <strong>80K subscribers on YouTube</strong> and <strong>168K followers on Instagram</strong>, bringing his profound expertise to the audience. The episode garnered over 40K views on Instagram and established a strong base of listeners for future episodes. The conversation covered various aspects of personal growth, the power of meditation, and how it can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs in terms of mental clarity and focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The podcast aims to create a platform for sharing authentic and insightful stories that inspire others. Each episode seeks to bring new perspectives on entrepreneurship, self-development, and navigating the challenges of building a successful career in the digital world. I’m excited about continuing to grow this podcast and collaborating with more incredible guests in the future.
